# Adventure Game
We are developing an adventure game using Java. In this game, we have 3 characters: Samurai, Archer, and Knight. When the game starts, the player must choose one of these characters. The characters have different abilities and starting stats:

- Samurai: 5 damage, 21 health, and 15 gold.
- Archer: 7 damage, 20 health, and 7 gold.
- Knight: 8 damage, 24 health, and 5 gold.

The game world consists of two main areas: the battlefield and the living area. The battlefield is divided into three difficulty levels: river, forest, and cave. The difficulty level increases as the player progresses through the areas. Each area has a different type of monster that the player must defeat:

- In the cave, there are zombies. Zombies have 3 damage, 10 health, and drop 4 gold when defeated.
- In the forest, there are vampires. Vampires have 4 damage, 14 health, and drop 7 gold when defeated.
- In the river, there are bears. Bears have 7 damage, 20 health, and drop 12 gold when defeated.

When the player enters a battlefield, they will face either one or three monsters, randomly selected. The player can collect gold from defeating monsters and use it to buy items in the living area market. The market sells armor and weapons. The weapons available are a pistol (2 damage, 25 gold), a sword (3 damage, 35 gold), and a rifle (7 damage, 45 gold). The armor available is light armor (1 block, 15 gold), medium armor (3 block, 25 gold), and heavy armor (5 block, 40 gold).

The player will receive a random item as a reward for clearing each area. If the player clears all three areas, they will receive three items: food in the cave, wood in the forest, and water in the river. The game ends when the player receives all three items.
